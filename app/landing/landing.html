		<p> Green is a crowdsourcing platform that aims to increase enviromental awareness. Reporting and discovering enviromental issues around you has never been easier. Green aims to bridge the gap between identifying and solving enviromental issues in the community. Through reporting issues, other users will be able to see issues around them and can decide if they would like to resolve that issue.
